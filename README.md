📊 Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning

# Customer Churn Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview
Analysis of telecom customer churn to identify key factors leading to customer attrition and provide actionable business insights.

## 🎯 Objective
- Identify patterns in customer churn
- Provide data-driven recommendations to reduce churn
- Showcase Python Pandas data analysis skills
  
  🔍 Project Overview

Cleaned and preprocessed real-world customer data

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover churn patterns and trends

Applied feature engineering to improve model performance

Trained and evaluated multiple machine learning classification models

Compared models using accuracy and classification metrics

Analyzed key features contributing to customer churn


## 📈 Key Findings
1. **26.5% overall churn rate** - Significant revenue at risk
2. **Month-to-month contracts** have 43% churn vs 11% for 2-year contracts
3. **Electronic check** payment method has 45% churn rate
4. Customers **without Online Security** are 42% more likely to churn
5. **New customers (0-12 months)** are highest risk

   
🧠 Key Takeaways
